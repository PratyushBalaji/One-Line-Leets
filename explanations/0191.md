# Solution 191 - Number of 1 Bits

## Solution : 

```python
def hammingWeight(self, n):
    return str(bin(n)).count("1")
```

## Explanation : 

This code counts the number of set bits (`1`s) in the binary representation of a given number.

We can use the Python built-in string method `<string>.count(<substring>) -> int` to check the number of occurrences of a substring in a string. By applying this method on the binary representation of the number `n` as a string with `str(bin(n))`, we can count how many `1`s there are and return this count.

## Equivalent Code : 

```python
def hammingWeight(self,n):
    count = 0 # initialising count
    binary = str(bin(n)) # binary representation of n
    for i in binary:
        if i == '1' # if current digit is a 1
            count+=1 # increment the count
    return count
```
