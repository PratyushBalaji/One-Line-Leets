# Solution 3110 - Score of a String

## Solution : 

```python
def scoreOfString(self, s):
    return sum([abs(ord(s[i])-ord(s[i+1])) for i in range(len(s)-1)])
```

## Explanation : 

This code takes the sum of a list comprehension on the input string `s`.

The `ord()` function in Python returns the ascii value of a given character. We can use this by iterating through `s` and taking the difference between adjacent characters.

First we iterate through all the indices in the string `s` except the last one (there is no "next" character after the last) like so : `[... for i in range(len(s)-1)]`

In a list comprehension, the ellipses (`...`) indicate what we want each element of the resulting list to be as an operation on the iterator `i`. In this case, we want it to be the **absolute** difference between consecutive characters' ascii values.

We compute the ascii values of neighbouring characters with `ord(s[i])` and `ord(s[i+1])`. Then we take their difference, and take the absolute value of the difference : `[abs(ord(s[i])-ord(s[i+1])) for i ...]`

This results in a list 1 element short of the length of `s` with the absolute ascii differences of each character. An input string `"abcd"` would result in an list `[abs(ord('a') - ord('b')),abs(ord('b') - ord('c')),abs(ord('c') - ord('d'))]` $=$ `[1,1,1]`

Finally, we take the sum of this list and return it with `return sum([...])`

## Equivalent Code : 

```python
def scoreOfString(self, s):
    total = 0 # total sum of differences
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        diff = ord(s[i]) - ord(s[i+1]) # ascii difference between characters
        absdiff = abs(diff) # absolute difference
        total += absdiff # adding difference to total
    return total # returning the sum
```
