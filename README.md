# One Line LeetCode Solutions

I like challenging myself to solve LeetCode problems in one single line. Code Golf : Line Edition

This game of mine started a few years ago when I would stumble upon LeetCode problems that had unsuspecting elegant solutions that could fit in just one return statement. I wasn't intetionally seeking out solutions that consisted of a single expression. However, my interest in trying to find such one-line solutions piqued when I began learning functional programming in Racket/Scheme at the University of Waterloo, and now it's become a personal challenge of mine.

## Rules : 
- Code must be one single line (One expression)

While `x=1; y=2; return x+y` is technically one line, for the spirit of the challenge this doesn't count as it is three "expressions"

However, while `return max(list(map(lambda pair: pair[0] ^ pair[1], filter(lambda pair: abs(pair[0]-pair[1]) <= min(pair[0],pair[1]), list(set([(nums[i], nums[j]) for i in range(len(nums)) for j in range(i, len(nums))]))))))` is a mouthful and a half, it is one single "expression". And so, it counts. (btw this is indeed a solution to [Problem #2932](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-strong-pair-xor-i/))

All solutions are titled by their corresponding problem number. File \<problem-number\>.py (`^[0-9].py$`) contains the problem description, a link to the problem, and my one line solution, sometimes with comments.

Disclaimer : These solutions are usually **extremely** inefficient. Sometimes they shine though.

## Solutions I find interesting :

### Problem [#2248](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-multiple-arrays) - Intersection of Multiple Arrays
`return sorted(reduce(lambda x,y:[i for i in x if i in y],nums))`

Uses `reduce()` which works like `foldr`, accumulating results and iterating through nums to find the intersection. First solution where I tried to incorporate my (then) newly gained knowledge of the "fold" Abstract List Functions.

### Problem [#1790](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-one-string-swap-can-make-strings-equal) - Check if One String Swap Can Make Strings Equal
`return (lambda ret: False if (len(s1) != len(s2)) or (len(ret) not in {0,2}) else len(ret) == 0 or (s1[ret[0]] == s2[ret[1]] and s1[ret[1]] == s2[ret[0]]))((lambda x, y: [i for i in range(len(x)) if x[i] != y[i]])(s1, s2))`

Stacks lambda functions and assigns a larger lambda call to `ret`, using its lambda nature to avoid recomputation while keeping the solution concise. First solution where I discovered the power of using a lambda function to "store" and use variables in my One-Line-Leets

### Problem [#3226](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-bit-changes-to-make-two-integers-equal) - Number of Bit Changes to Make Two Integers Equal
Original solution : `return str(bin(n^k)).count('1') if n - (n&k) - (n^k) == k - (n&k) else 0 if n == k else -1`

Optimised solution : `return str(bin(n^k)).count('1') if n - (n^k) == k else -1`

I like this solution a lot because it uses clever bit manipulation to form an elegant, efficient solution. Let's look at why it works : 

`n&k` represents the bits in `n` and `k` that are the same. We can just ignore these bits entirely, hence they are subtracted from both. This isn't entirely necessary since we're subtracting on both sides, but when I was drawing binary numbers on my whiteboard to figure this problem out, it was immensely helpful.

Now, we're left with residuals of `n` and `k`, comprising only of the digits between them that are different. `n^k` represents the bits that are different between the two numbers. Since the question requires that we only change `1`s in `n` to `0`s and not the other way round, this must mean that if it is possible to transform `n` to `k`, subtracting the differing bits (essentially converting all ones to zeroes) should result in `k` itself! That's why we check if `n - n^k == k`!

If this is true (we *can* transform `n` into `k`), then the number of bits we changed is the number of ones in the differing bits, so we do `str(bin(n^k)).count('1'`. If not, we also have to check if there are no differing bits (not necessary since `n^k` would be zero in this case, returning no counted ones, but for the sake of explicitly stating cases, we return `0`). If both of these cases are not true, then it is not possible to convert `n` to `k`, hence we return `-1`

Actually, the solution can be made much simpler by removing the redundant subtractions of `n&k` and the unecessary check to see if the values are equal like so : `return str(bin(n^k)).count('1') if n - (n^k) == k else -1`, which ends up beating 100% of submissions in both runtime (0ms) and memory (12.30MB) according to LeetCode. 

I love the elegance of this solution and how simple logic gates are super useful and efficient in solving this problem!
