# You are given the root of a full binary tree with the following properties:
#     Leaf nodes have either the value 0 or 1, where 0 represents False and 1 represents True.
#     Non-leaf nodes have either the value 2 or 3, where 2 represents the boolean OR and 3 represents the boolean AND.
# The evaluation of a node is as follows:
#     If the node is a leaf node, the evaluation is the value of the node, i.e. True or False.
#     Otherwise, evaluate the node's two children and apply the boolean operation of its value with the children's evaluations.
# Return the boolean result of evaluating the root node.
# A full binary tree is a binary tree where each node has either 0 or 2 children.
# A leaf node is a node that has zero children.
